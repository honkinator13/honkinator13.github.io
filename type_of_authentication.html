<h1 style="text-align: left;">What type of authentication is used the most?</h1> <!--h1 that is aligned to the left-->
<h2 class="solid">Most common types: Password based authentication</h2> <!--h2 using solid class-->
<div class="center"> <!--div using center-->
    <p>Password-based authentication is the most common type of authentication used today. It requires users to enter a username and password to access their accounts. While it is widely used, it is also vulnerable to various attacks, such as phishing and brute-force attacks. It can also suffer from easy to use password which can make the hacker be able to infiltrate the account much more easier.</p>

<h2 class="solid">2nd most common type: Knowledge based authentication</h2> <!--h2 using solid class-->
<div class="center"> <!--div using center-->
    <p>Knowledge-based authentication requires users to answer security questions or provide personal information to verify their identity. It is good in that it can help make it more secured that a regular password system. It revovles around personal question which can make the result unpredictable. However it can be less secure than other methods, as answers to security questions can often be found through the user's social media and it is also inconvienient as the user might be lock out of their account if they forget the answer.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="solid">3rd most common types: Possession based Authentication</h2> <!--h2 using solid class-->
<div class="center"> <!--div using center-->
    <p>Possession-based authentication requires users to have a physical device, such as a smartphone, to access their accounts. This method is more secure than password-based authentication as it requires something the user has physically and a password which is strong. However, it can be inconvenient if the user loses their device or if the device is not available.</p>
