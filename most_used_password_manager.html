<h2 class="solid">Best free password manager</h2>
<div class="center">
    <p>Bitwarden is a free password manager that has a lot of features that are not available in other free password managers. It has the ability to have data breach monitoring which can be very helpful. It has a very good user interface and it is open source which means that the code can be looked at by anyone. The only downside is that it does not have a 2 factor authentication which can impact security as they can just rely on passwords to access your entire passwords.</p>
